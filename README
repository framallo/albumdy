Yet another open source photo gallery application.

There are many existing photo gallery apps around, but none I could find demonstrating the following key technologies:
- Built with Ruby on Rails: http://www.rubyonrails.org/
- CSS layout with Blueprint CSS: http://code.google.com/p/blueprintcss/
- Client side scripting with the popular and unobtrusive jQuery: http://jquery.com/
- Lightboxing effects using Leandro Vieira Pinho's jQuery lightBox: http://leandrovieira.com/projects/jquery/lightbox/
- Textboxing effects using Cody Lindley's ThickBox: http://jquery.com/demo/thickbox/
- Thin controllers with James Golick's resource_controller: http://jamesgolick.com/resource_controller
- File uploads and thumbnail generation with Thoughtbot's Paperclip: http://www.thoughtbot.com/projects/paperclip
- User Registration with Rick Olson's restful_authentication: http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication
- Plugin management for Git with Cristi Balan's Braid: http://github.com/evilchelu/braid
- Project hosting with GitHub: http://github.com/
- Organized nested routes as described in Regulators!!! Mount up: http://giantrobots.thoughtbot.com/2008/7/10/regulators-mount-up

See a live demo at http://albumdy.com

You will need the following gems installed:
1. sudo gem install mime-types http://mime-types.rubyforge.org/
2. sudo gem install right_aws (If you want to use Amazon S3 for storage, although paperclip + S3 is buggy at the moment)
3. sudo gem install exifr
3. sudo gem install GeoRuby
